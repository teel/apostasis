=over 4

=item logger

The name of the logger. This value defaults to "You". The name of 
the logger is not required for version 2 or later logs (since they
contain the logger's real name).

=item version

"1" or "2", "3" for pre-2.4, post-2.4, and post-4.2 logs respectively. 
The version defaults to 3.

=item year

This optional argument can be used to specify a different year. The
year defaults to the current year.
